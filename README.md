üÉè HTML/CSS Playing Cards Display
This project demonstrates how to replicate the visual design of standard playing cards (Ace, King, Queen) using only HTML and CSS. It serves as a practical exercise in advanced CSS layout, positioning, and styling techniques.

‚ú® Key Features
*  Pure CSS Cards: The entire card structure, including the numbers/letters and the suit icons, is rendered without relying on any external images or SVG files (suits are likely achieved using Unicode or pseudo-elements).

* Aesthetic Design: Features clean lines, appropriate spacing, and subtle box shadows to give the cards a realistic, three-dimensional look.

* Layout Practice: Uses modern CSS techniques (likely Flexbox or Grid) to arrange the three cards horizontally within a central container.

* Suit Replication: Achieves the Spade (‚ô†), Heart (‚ô•), and Diamond (‚ô¶) suits using creative CSS methods (e.g., character codes or custom shapes).

üíª Technologies Used
* HTML5: Provides the foundational structure for the card elements and their container.

* CSS3: Handles all styling, sizing, positioning, coloring, and visual effects (like the rounded corners and shadows).

üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup
To run this project locally, simply:

1. Clone or Download: Get the project files onto your machine.

2. Open index.html: Open the main HTML file in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

The three playing cards will be displayed centered on the screen.

‚öôÔ∏è Customization
This project can be easily extended and customized:

* Add More Cards: Duplicate the existing card HTML structure and update the rank (2, 3, 4, J, etc.) and suit elements to expand the display.

* Change Suits: Modify the CSS content or color properties to change the displayed suits (e.g., swapping a Heart for a Club).

* Apply Animations: Introduce CSS transformations or transitions (like hover effects or slight rotations) to make the cards interactive.
